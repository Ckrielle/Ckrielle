<h1 align="center">Hello There ✌️</h1>

In the digital world I go by ckrielle. It's pronounced criel. The rest of the characters are there for flair. I very much like computers and most technologies and concepts, but I have a personal love for low level stuff. I also do security, with my main focal point being low level security. I mostly like doing reverse engineering, and have spent many years playing CTFs and practicing that. But I also really like exploitation. I combine these two professionaly, working as a Vulnerability Researcher at [CENSUS Labs](https://census-labs.com/), and also on my personal free time playing CTFs for different teams and doing research for [i0.rs](https://i0.rs/). Some other topics I like are malwares, compilers, hardware.

My projects and repos are mostly things I find cool and I dedicate a few days to weeks in sprinting them out. I don't know if they would be helpful to people, but feel free to look around. I want to believe I'm good enough at C and Python, and I have some exposure to C++ and linux scripting. If you want to collaborate on anything, feel free to reach me out by dming me on X @[ckrielle](https://x.com/ckrielle)
