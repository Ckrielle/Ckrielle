### Hello there ✌️

My name is machina and this is my Github Profile. This is where I upload all my projects. When I first started out programming I thought that programmers didn't like flash and pretty things (excpet pretty code). Turns out they like ✨a e s t h e t i c✨ things (and emojis too). Some I get, some I don't. All I know is that people like a good README.md. And hey, so do I😌

A basic briefing:

- 💙 I love Ethical Hacking (Crypto, RE), Linux (I use Arch btw), Python
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Fanimator](https://github.com/Ckrielle/Faminator), and uni exams
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about life. And I got an arduino so there's that
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on python projects
- 💬 Ask me about manga and why everyone should use linux
- ⚡ Fun fact: Scio Latine

Here is my social ranking score, I always see people have a good ranking with meh stats so hope I don't get a B.
