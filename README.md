<h1 align="center">Hello There ✌️ Welcome To My Profile</h1>
<h3 align="center">Be sure to follow me and star my projects ⭐</h3>

My name is Ckrielle/Machina/Korai and this is my Github Profile. This is where I upload all my projects, along with other things like writeups. When I first started learing about CS I thought that programmers, and generally tech people didn't like flashy and pretty things (except pretty code). Turns out they like ✨a e s t h e t i c✨ things (and emojis too). Some I get, some I don't. All I know is that people like a good README.md. And hey, so do I😌

Some things about me:

- 💙 I love: Ethical Hacking (Crypto, RE), Linux (I use Arch btw), Python
- 🔭 I’m currently working on: [Fanimator](https://github.com/Ckrielle/Faminator), and uni exams
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: about life. And I got an arduino so there's that
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: python projects and CTF teams
- 💬 Ask me about: manga, why everyone should use linux, and why Aurelian was the best roman emperor
- ⚡ Fun fact: Scio Latine

Here are my stats, I always see people have a good ranking with meh stats so hope I don't get sth like a B.

*EDIT OF EDIT: No it doesn't, it just means I'm not dead last😩. Not for long though😤
